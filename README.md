# lie-detection
 B.Tech Final Year Project

Computer vision isÂ **a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos**.

## MediaPipe - Machine Learning Solution
An open source, cross-platform, customizable ML solution for live and streaming media for image and video processing.

## OpenCV
OpenCV provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library, tools, and hardware. It also supports model execution for Machine Learning (ML)

We perform feature extraction on the person in the video using MediaPipe and use machine learning algorithm to detect lie.
